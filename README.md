Simple system monitor on the
[Divoom Pixoo](https://divoom.com/products/divoom-pixoo/).

Displays info about volume, RAM usage, CPU usage, GPU usage, GPU VRAM usage,
network upload, and network download in that order as colored progress bars, as
well as the current time up to the second.

## Usage

Currently, this program is very specific to my exact PC setup. It only works on
Linux, only with AMD GPUs, and several device names etc. are hard-coded as
constants at the top. Make sure to pair your Pixoo before running this.
